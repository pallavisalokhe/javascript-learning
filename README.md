- math.random() used for print random value 0 to 0.99 not for 1
- math.floor() print largest integer
- Math.ceil()used for returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to a decimal number.
- by using Number.isInteger() on the built-in Number object that checks if a number is an integer.
- for single line use // and multiple line use /* */
- by using .toUpperCase() string return in capital letter
- By usind .trim() we remove the space before and affer the string
## Variables
- for storing and holding the data
- for declaring variable use var,let,const
- Comparison operators, including <, >, <=, >=, ===, and !== can compare two values.
- logical operator(OR=||,and=&&,not=!)
-  javascript supports arithmetic(+,-,*,/,%) and assignment operato(+=,-=,*=,/=)
-  ++ is increment operator and -- is decrement operator
-  + operator can be used to combine two string values even if those values are being stored in variables
-  The type of operator checks the value to its right and returns, or passes back, a string of the data type.
## Conditional
-  If statement is evaluate when condition is true otherwise it is not executing 
- else statement is executing when if condition is fail
- elseif clause consist many else if conditions 
- Falsy values include false, 0, empty strings, null undefined, and NaN. All other values are truthy
- we can use a ternary operator to simplify an if...else statement.We use expressions follow the ? and are separated by a colon :.
- A switch statement can be used to simplify the process of writing multiple else if statements. The break keyword stops the remaining cases from being checked and executed in a switch statement.
## Functions
- there are many way to create function
  --function declaration: It consist function keyword,Identifier,function body.
